# Decorporation - game jam version
A bullet-hell dynamic roguelike FPS about destroying an evil corporation. 
It was made in 5 days for Krakjam 2022 (part of Global Game Jam). The theme was **Duality**.

This is an open-source game jam version with some critical bug fixes and improvements.
**Check out the full version (coming soon on Steam) - [decorporation.cubepotato.eu](https://decorporation.cubepotato.eu)**

Don't look at the source code pls it was written mostly at 3am and it's often a hell of spaghetti code.
